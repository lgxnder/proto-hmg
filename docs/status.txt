This file will be periodically updated to reflect the changes I have made from the original source code (the html file) of proto23.


- Moved the styles written in css into their own file. Styles updated in javascript
        like dom.someelement.style.display = none; are not moved in order to prevent any conflicts
        with the way the game updates. Maybe subject to change ...

- Various indentation fixes in places where a bunch of code with 'if' and 'for' statements was 
        written have been expanded to fall over multiple lines instead. Additionally, lines
        where multiple clauses of a similar nature were tightly packed close together have been
        moved, too. This will probably increase the overall lines of the already quite big html
        file but, I believe this will be worth it in the end. Honestly, the endeavour to add
        indentation to everything is more so a visual aid for my eyes.

- Rearranged the save/load function definitions in order to further organize the beginning initialization of variables/objects/STUFF.

GENERAL TODO:
 - document what things in the code actually does (lol)
 - maybe rename/refactor some stuff?
